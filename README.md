# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
The Purpose of this analysis was to get familiar writing code through the use of VBA.  This challenge required a lot of work and patience.
## Results
### Analysis
For 2017, all stocks except for TERP yeilded a positive return. For 2018, ENPH and RUN had very positive returns, but the rest of the stocks suffered significant negative returns.  The execution time of the refactored script was consistently around 0.3 seconds after running the code.  This a huge improvement of the original script which had an execution time of around 1 second.
## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages
Some advantaged of refactoring code include the code being more organized, therefore being easier to read.  Another advantage is faster programming.  Having advantages for refactoring code, there are also disadvantages.  There are risks from the size of applications.  Having applications that are too big may cause complications with not possessing the proper test cases for the existing codes.
### Conclusion
The decrease in execution time of about two thirds is extremely beneficial.  Having code that is unorganized can be frustrating for someone trying to read it.![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109995136/183745377-22ec1b10-ffb4-40f9-85ac-ee0c293734bb.png)
